# # Regular expressions

# Use cases (always strings)
# - data validation
# - data extraction

## Step 1

# - create a method that takes a postcode (string) as parameter
# - it should return true if the postcode is a valid dutch postcode
# - call the method 2 times: 1 time with a valid postcode, 1 time with an invalid postcode (and display the result)

## Step 2

# - create a method that takes a full name as parameter
# - IF the name is valid, then it should return a hash containing 2 keys: first_name and last_name
# - OTHERWISE, it should return empty hash
# - call the method and display the result
# - call the method 2 times: 1 time with a valid full name, 1 time with an invalid full name (and display the result)
